# Counting in Binary and Hex

## Key terminology

- A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). The binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, because of the simplicity of the language and the noise immunity in physical implementation.

-  The hexadecimal numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of 16. Unlike the decimal system representing numbers using 10 symbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values 0 to 9, and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") to represent values from 10 to 15.
Software developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. 

- A decimal system - a number system that uses a notation in which each number is expressed in base 10 by using one of the first nine integers or 0 in each place and letting each place value be a power of 10.
Most human languages use a decimal system to represent numbers.

2. Translate the following binary numbers into decimal:

|Binary   | Decimal |                                  |
|:--------|---------|---------------------------------:|
|1010 1010| 170     | 128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 170           |
|1111 0000| 240     | 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240         |
|1101 1011| 219     | 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 219  |
|1010 0000| 160     | 128 + 32 = 160                   |
|0011 1010| 58      | 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 58             |


3. Translate the following decimal numbers into hexadecimal:
