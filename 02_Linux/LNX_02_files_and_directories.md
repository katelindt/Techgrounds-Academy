# Files and Directories

Creating and editing files


## Key terminology

- Directory - a file system cataloging structure which contains references to other computer files, and possibly other directories. 
- Absolute path - complete path from start of actual file system from / directory.
- Relative path - path related to the present working directly(pwd)

- Commands: 
    - pwd - print working directory
    - ls - list files
    - mkdir - create the directory
    - cd - change directory
    - echo - display line of text/string that are passed as an argument
    - cat - one of its most common usages is to print the content of a file onto the standard output stream. Other than that, the cat command also allows us to write some texts into a file.


## Exercise
- Find out your current working directory.
- Make a listing of all files and directories in your home directory. You should see directories like ‘Desktop’, ‘Public’ and ‘Pictures’ among others.
- Within your home directory, create a new directory named ‘techgrounds’.
- Within the techgrounds directory, create a file containing some text.
- Move around your directory tree using both absolute and relative paths.
