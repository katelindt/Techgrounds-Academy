# Setting up

Connecting to Linux VM


## Key terminology

- CLI - command line
- GUI - grafical user interface
- VM - virtual Machine
- SSH - Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data.

## Exercise
- Make an SSH-connection to your machine. SSH requires the key file to have specific permissions, so you might need to change those.
- When the connection is successful, type whoami in the terminal. This command should show your username.
