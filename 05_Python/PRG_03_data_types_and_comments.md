# Data types and comments
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Comments can be used to explain Python code, to make the code more readable,to prevent execution when testing code.

## Key terminology

- Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them
- Data types
    - Text Type:	str - technically an array of characters. Strings are denoted using “ ” double quotes or ‘ ’ single quotes.
    - Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
    - Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
    - Mapping Type:	dict
    - Set Types:	set, frozenset
    - Boolean Type:	bool - A binary state that is either True or False.
    - Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
    - None Type:	NoneType

## Exercise

- Exercise 1:
    - Create a new script.
    - Copy the code below into your script.
    a = 'int'
    b = 7
    c = False
    d = "18.5"
    - Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.
    - Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
    - Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

- Exercise 2:
    - Create a new script.
    - Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
    - Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
