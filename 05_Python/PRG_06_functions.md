# Functions
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

## Key terminology

- In Python a function is defined using the def keyword

- To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis

- Exercise 1:
    - Create a new script.
    - Import the random package.
    - Print 5 random integers with a value between 0 and 100.

- Exercise 2:
    - Create a new script.
    - Write a custom function myfunction() that prints “Hello, world!” to the terminal. Call myfunction.
    - Rewrite your function so that it takes a string as an argument. Then, it should print “Hello, <string>!”.

- Exercise 3:
    - Create a new script.
    - Copy the code below into your script.
    def avg():
    write your code here
    x = 128
    y = 255
    z = avg(x,y)
    - print ("The average of",x,"and", y, "is", z)
