# Conditions

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

## Key terminology
- Elif - the elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
- Else - the else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

## Exercise

- Exercise 1:
    - Create a new script.
    - Use the input() function to ask the user of your script for their name. If the name they input is your name, print a personalized welcome message. If not, print a different personalized message.

- Exercise 2:
    - Create a new script.
    - Ask the user of your script for a number. Give them a response based on whether the number is higher than, lower than, or equal to 100.
    - Make the game repeat until the user inputs 100.
