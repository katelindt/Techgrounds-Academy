# Loops

## Key terminology


## Exercise

- Exercise 1:
    - Create a new script.
    - Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
    - Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

- Exercise 2:
    - Create a new script.
    - Copy the code below into your script.
    for i in range(10):
     do something here
    - Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
    - Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
    - Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

- Exercise 3:
    - Create a new script.
    - Copy the array below into your script.
    arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
    - Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
