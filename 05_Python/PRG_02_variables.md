# Variables

Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## Key terminology

Variables are containers for storing data values.

## Exercise
- Exercise 1:
    - Create a new script.
    - Create two variables x and y. Assign a numerical value to both variables.
    - Print the values of x and y.
    - Create a third variable named z. The value of z should be the sum of x and y.
    - Print the value of z.

- Exercise 2:
    - Create a new script.
    - Create a variable name. The value of name should be your name.
    - Print the text “Hello, <your name here>!”. Use name in the print statement.

- Exercise 3:
    - Create a new script.
    - Create a variable and assign a value to it.
    - Print the text “Value 1: <value 1 here>”.
    - Change the value of that same variable.
    - Print the text “Value 2: <value 2 here>”.
    - Change the value of that same variable.
    - Print the text “Value 3: <value 3 here>”.
