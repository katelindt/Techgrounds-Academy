# Lists
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

## Key terminology

- append() - adds an element at the end of the list.

- .extend() - adds more than one elements at the end of the list.

- insert() - adds an element at a given position in the list

- remove() - removes an element from the list.

- pop() - can remove an element from any position in the list.

- reverse() - is used to reverse the elements of the list.

- len() - returns the length of the list, i.e. the number of elements in the list.

- index() - returns the position of the first occurrence of the given element.

- count() - returns the number of elements with the specified value.

- sort() - sorts the list in ascending order.

- clear() - erases all the elements from the list and empties them.



## Exercise

- Exercise 1:
    - Create a new script.
    - Create a variable that contains a list of five names.
    - Loop over the list using a for loop. Print every individual name in the list on a new line.

- Exercise 2:
    - Create a new script.
    - Create a list of five integers.
    - Use a for loop to do the following for every item in the list:
    - Print the value of that item added to the value of the next item in the list. If it is the last item, add it to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).
