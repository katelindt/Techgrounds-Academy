### Overcome challenges

### Results

- The AWS Well-Architected Tool is designed to help you review the state of your applications and workloads against architectural best practices, identify opportunities for improvement, and track progress over time.

- Cost Optimization Pillar
The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
    - Implement cloud financial management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure

- Reliability Pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation

- Operational Excellence Pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.
    - Perform operations as code
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operationsâ€™ procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational failures


- Performance Efficiency Pillar
The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.
    - Democratize advanced technologies: Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy

- Security Pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.
    - Implement a strong security foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - Prepare for security events

- Sustainability Pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts. 
    - Understand your impact
    - Establish sustainability goals
    - Maximize utilization
    - Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
    - Use managed services
    - Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
