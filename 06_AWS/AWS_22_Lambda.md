# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.

## Key terminology

- Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.

- An AWS Lambda function - the code you run on AWS Lambda is uploaded as a “Lambda function”. Each function has associated configuration information, such as its name, description, entry point, and resource requirements. The code must be written in a “stateless” style i.e. it should assume there is no affinity to the underlying compute infrastructure.

- An event source is an AWS service or developer-created application that produces events that trigger an AWS Lambda function to run.
