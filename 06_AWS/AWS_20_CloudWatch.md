# AWS CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. 

## Key terminology
- Amazon CloudWatch is used to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files your applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your application running smoothly.

- Amazon CloudWatch Logs lets you monitor and troubleshoot your systems and applications using your existing system, application and custom log files.

- Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection applies machine-learning algorithms to continuously analyze single time series of systems and applications, determine a normal baseline, and surface anomalies with minimal user intervention

- Amazon CloudWatch ServiceLens is a feature that enables you to visualize and analyze the health, performance, and availability of your applications in a single place.

- Contributor Insights analyzes time-series data to provide a view of the top contributors influencing system performance. 

- Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allows to monitor application endpoints more easily.

An alarm has three possible states: 
- OK – The metric is within the defined threshold. 
- ALARM – The metric is outside the defined threshold.
- INSUFFICIENT_DATA – The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.
