# Git and GitHub

Basic concepts of version control system


## Key terminology

- Repository - a central location in which data is stored and managed. Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project. It saves this data in a directory called .git, also known as the repository folder.
- Git - free and open source software for distributed version control
- Clone - used to copy an existing Git repository into a new local directory.
- Markdown (.md) - lightweight markup language
- Main / Master - default branch
- Branch - an independent line of development.
- Commit - an operation which sends the latest changes of the source code to the repository
- Push - a command which is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
- Pull - a command which is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
- Merge - a procedure to connect the forked history. It joins two or more development history together. 
- Fork - a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Exercise
- Create a GitHub repo.

### Overcome challenges

I had some issues with .DS_Store, but I found the solution to put it in .gitignore

### Results

I created a new repository, cloned the Cloud9 repository (what was optional) and invited my teammates.
